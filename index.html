<p> <b><font size="10">(sorry for all the serious talk, memes are followed by this. well, the school thinks that they can dictate my life outside of school which is obviouly incorrect
    because the school day only spans from 7:50 to 2:40 or any time i am on school property,
    at no time during these hours or on your property did i build this website, and because of you, i will put it back up
    on monday. i have been advised not to take advice from you, your are a adminastrator and you know how to administrate,
    you are not supposed to dictate. if you wish to punish me for doing something on my own free time, i would like to interject
    because it is not legal for you to tell me what to do in my free time. i was told this information from a lawyer incase you were
    asking. if you don't like the things your staff has said thats your staffs fault and not mine. at this point,
    until monday at 2:41 all content regarding the west hollow staff or students including the picture of mr, regulinski, which i will
    not be putting back up is down. this is all i have to sayto you. are you happy? are you happy that you made me take down
    something i dedicated ard work and time to on my own free time? is this what you wanted? i thought we were supposed to
    stand up for what is right and follow our own paths and dreams, but apparently not. </font></b></p>
