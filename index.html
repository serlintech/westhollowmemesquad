 The purpose of this website is to inform the Dix Hills community of the injustices of Mr.Steve Hauk who will make $177,000 this year
 and his partners in crime, MR. Eric Seely formerly known as the gym teacher from Brooklyn
 and Allison Beyersdorf Who observationally does very little. We will objectively prove these things using facts and quotes.
